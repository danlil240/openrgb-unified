|||   Portable workspace bundle: a directory containing    ||
|||     studio.json                — the sanitized v3 doc  ||
|||     presets/devices/*.device.json — every referenced   ||
|||                                     type (transitive)  ||
|||     assets/<rel>               — referenced assets     ||
|||                                                           |
|||   Export strips local hardware identity (serial /      ||
|||   location), forces verified + live flags off, and     ||
|||   copies only what the workspace actually uses.        ||
|||   Import inspects first (no writes), classifies each   ||
|||   bundled type new|identical|conflict against the      ||
|||   local library, then applies with explicit same-id    ||
|||   conflict choices — a different-content local type    ||
|||   is never overwritten. The applied workspace is a     ||
|||   CANDIDATE: the caller runs it through the normal     ||
|||   load/resolve path, so a rejected import leaves the   ||
|||   active scene untouched.                              ||
|||                                                           |
|||   Qt-free (nlohmann json + std::filesystem) so the     ||
|||   fast test suite covers it.                           ||
|||                                                           |
